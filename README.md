# The Red Rising API

# What is the Red Rising API? 
I LOVE the <a href="https://www.piercebrown.com/" target="_blank">Red Rising saga written by Pierce Brown</a> and I was really bummed that there wasn't a Red Rising API out there yet (or at least I couldn't find one). I'm setting out to build the biggest and baddest RR api in the galaxy. 

**Link to project:** Check out the API <a href="https://red-rising-api.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Javascript, Node, Express

I created a server using Node and Express. I will be adding more HTML, CSS and Javascript as I keep building. 

## Optimizations

This is very much still a work-in-progress. Right now the API only accepts requests for characters and certain attributes. I hope to continue to grow the API with requests such as alliances, planets, family trees, color meaning and sigils. You can access a simple client side interface <a href="https://github.com/michellelavergne/red-rising-client-side" target="__blank>here</a> to demo how it works. 


## Lessons Learned:

This is my first stab at building an API and it was A LOT of fun. I also learned how to use Heroku, Node and Express.
