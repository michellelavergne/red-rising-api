# The Red Rising API

# What is the Red Rising API? 
I LOVE the Red Rising saga and I was really bummed that there wasn't a Red Rising API out there yet (or at least I couldn't find one). I'm setting out to build the biggest and baddest RR api in the galaxy. 

**Link to project:** Check out the API <a href="https://red-rising-api.herokuapp.com/">here</a>

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Javascript, Node, Express

I created a server using Node and Express. I will be adding more HTML, CSS and Javascript as I keep building. 

## Optimizations

Right now the API only accepts requests for characters and certain attributes. I hope to continue to grow the API with requests such as alliances, planets, family trees, color meaning and sigils. 


## Lessons Learned:

This is my first stab at building an API and it was A LOT of fun.
